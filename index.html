               <h2> Do we use handwriting these days? </h2>
               <p>"In our modern world, especially nowadays when nearly everything
                  is virtual, typing on the computer, phone or other devices has 
                  almost replaced handwriting. We keep our important documents on 
                  our computers, write e-mails instead of letters, do our shopping 
                  lists on applications and so on. We use pen and paper less and 
                  less each day. However, for some people, like me, handwriting 
                  still preserves its importance. I am talking about a different 
                  type of handwriting, the 'beautiful handwriting'"</p>

               <h2> Why I wanted to learn Calligraphy </h2>
               <p>"Calligraphy is composed of two Greek words for “beauty” (kallos) and “to write” (graphein). 
                  I was impressed by this art when my husband sent me a letter before our marriage. On the 
                  envelope, he wrote my name with a calligraphy pen. I wanted to learn this art and started 
                  to learn with the help of my husband. All I needed was a calligraphy pen, paper and ink."

               <h2>Benefits of writing Calligraphy for me</h2>
               <p>"I think it makes me feel great. First of all, it helps me relax when I am stressed. 
                  When I start writing, I become so concentrated that I forget about all the stressful 
                  events I went through. Moreover, I can write my friend’s names or their favourite 
                  quotations and give them to my friends as presents , which make them really happy. 
                  I am still not in advanced level, but I want to improve myself and become more 
                  talented on this area. "</p>
